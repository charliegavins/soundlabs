### Background

Administrating the rights of songs is currently a costly process. Agreeing splits and paying royalties accurately is done by big companies with high head counts, often manually, taking a % of those royalties, rather than retainers. Much of this can now be avoided through the use of well implemented technology.

### Mission

Is there a more efficient, automated/user generated system that can be implemented that minimises overhead and maximises payout.
