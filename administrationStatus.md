What could be explored is a model that increases accuracy of song ownership and registration depending on it’s success. The less a song makes, the less accurate/robust the agreement needs to be.

$0 - ‘tag’ rights holders into the song, including any infringed copyrights such as samples/cover version etc but nothing more needed.

If song generates activity - either through plays, sampling or licensing, which in turn generates revenue, then this rough arrangement can be agreed by simple user interface rather than long form contracts.

If song contains samples and is highly successful then it can then be elevated to seasoned industry professionals to work through the finer detail. Any marginal improvements that this gives will be much more noticeable at this stage

Any system that is devised should charge a subscription fee, rather than percentage of royalties.
