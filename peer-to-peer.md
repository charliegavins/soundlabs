Background

The main reason for lack of adoption for artists in this system is the lack of remuneration. Lets explore the benefits:

- Fan-to-fan distribution of music

Fans share their music with other likeminded music fans, bringing communities of music lovers together in a way that isnâ€™t seen as much on current centralised systems.

- technical innovation

Open frameworks can pave the way for innovation to grow by lowering the barrier to entry of technologists.

- User generated

Allows for fans to have an active role in music distribution. Original, high quality vinyl rips, rare cuts and other gems found in the collections worldwide can create a more collaborative and organic approach to music - more akin to a record store than a laboratory. Users can listen to the music they want to, in the format they want, in the version that works for them. And then share that high quality gem with friends.

Mission

To fully study what makes private and public trackers so successful. The economy of bandwidth and uploading/downloading - and can a strategy be developed that allows for these currently marginalised systems be legitimised and encouraged to thrive.
