### Background

Art has always been subject to the confines of the medium. In music as soon as there has been a way to record music onto something, there has been the requirement to offer as complete a work as possible because of an inability to make changes and improvements later.

Digital media has opened up new possibilities in this field

### Mission

Reduce the friction of release to a minimum.

Develop an environment that encourages the distribution of ideas, not finished works. Explore mechanics of version control and idea sketching and how that may be encouraged in a supportive and artist friendly way.
