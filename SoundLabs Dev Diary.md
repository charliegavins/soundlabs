### SoundLabs Dev Diary

11.03.17

Starting up the dev diary a little late - the site's content is basically there with the links and general functionality there.

I'm reopening to refine the layout to make it feel more finished and polished.

The main areas that need to be addressed are:

- Quotes on front page
	- It would be good to have only one quote appear at any one time, and reformat them

- Footer
	- SoundLabs appears in too many places and can be removed.
	- Correct the mission statement grammar
	- set up SoundLabs github? Is that even possible?

- URL 
	-	Decide on URL and purchase

- Don't have the title of the pages appear in the header and in the main body of the text. Instead use icons/illustrations perhaps?

- Philosophy
	- On this page make the text less one dimensional

- Projects
	- Make text look less one dimensional
	- List the projects in a more interesting way - images?
	- The projects themselves should have a more uniform and well designed look - they should also have restful URLS
	- Is there a way to fit all of the projects on one page? TBD
- People
	- Illustrations again?
