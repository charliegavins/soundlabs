Background

There is a lot of administrative overhead that is tied up in song rights administration which affects the artists who should be the beneficiaries of any royalties. This not only reduces ultimate payout but often cripples creative output. Much of this can now be avoided through the use of well implemented technology.

Mission

Is there a more efficient system that can be explored that minimises overhead and maximises payout.  

What could be explored is a model that increases accuracy of song ownership and registration depending on it’s success. The less a song makes, the less accurate/robust the agreement needs to be.

$0 - ‘tag’ rights holders into the song, including any infringed copyrights such as samples/cover version etc but nothing more needed.

If song generates activity - either through plays, sampling or licensing, which in turn generates revenue, then this rough arrangement can be agreed by simple user interface rather than long form contracts.

If song contains samples and is highly successful then it can then be elevated to seasoned industry professionals to work through the finer detail. Any marginal improvements that this gives will be much more noticeable at this stage
