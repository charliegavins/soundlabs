### Background

Artists want their voice heard. They want their message spread. They also want to know that fans appreciate what they do, and allow them to continue to support them in their work.

A physical exchange of goods for money works well for physical items. When we work with digital, the rules change - because files can be copied and distributed for next to nothing.

We need a different model of ‘exchange’ given this new artefact in the supply of ‘goods’.

### Mission

Explore reversed approach to financial support for artists. Distribute music so people can access it without barriers such as adverts or paywalls (drm). Instead put the focus on how fans can give back - encourage donations by making it easy to do so.

Artist to user
- direct one-off payments
- pay as you go
- monthly payments split by listening habits
Artist to business
- shops/bars/clubs etc
